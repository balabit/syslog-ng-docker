# `balabit/syslog-ng`
  * Syslog-ng is installed with all of its modules
  * Within the container syslog-ng will start in foreground. This is useful because if there is some error with syslog-ng we can easily check the output console log through the `docker logs [containerID]` command
  * You can use your own `syslog-ng.conf` or fall back to use the default one

The following ports are exposed:
 * Syslog UDP: 514,
 * Syslog TCP: 601,
 * Syslog TLS: 6514

Syslog-ng will listen on these ports and forwards the logs into the file
`/var/log/syslog`. You can check the default configuration in the source
repository of this image.

Please check the syslog-ng image tags at the official docker repository to know what image versions exist  [https://registry.hub.docker.com/u/balabit]

## Using default configuration
Assume that the following ports are not used on host machine, because they can conflict: `514`, `601`:

```bash
sudo docker run -it -p 514:514/udp -p 601:601 --name syslog-ng balabit/syslog-ng:latest
```
By default syslog-ng will not print any debug messages to the console. If you want to see more debug messages you need to start the containers in this way:

```bash
sudo docker run -it -p 514:514/udp -p 601:601 --name syslog-ng balabit/syslog-ng:latest -edv
```

## Using custom syslog-ng configuration
You can extend the default configuration by mounting a configuration folder under `/etc/syslog-ng/conf.d/syslog-ng.conf`:

```bash
sudo docker run -it -v "$PWD/conf.d":/etc/syslog-ng/conf.d balabit/syslog-ng:latest
```

The docker container does not accept any input by default a configuration file containing source, destination and log definitions is required.

## Reading logs from other containers
An example is used to describe how syslog-ng can read logs from other containers.

Assume that you have already running an `apache2` container which exposes its logs as a mounted volume under "/var/log/apache2/". We will read the apache logs and send them to a remote host (`1.2.3.4:514`). The example syslog-ng configuration file is stored in the current directory as `syslog-ng.conf`.

```
@version: 3.7

source s_apache {
  file("/var/log/apache2/access.log");
};

destination d_remote {
  tcp("1.2.3.4" port(514));
};

log {
  source(s_apache);
  destination(d_remote);
};
```

Now we can start syslog-ng:

```bash
sudo docker run -it --volumes-from [containerID for apache2] -v "$PWD/syslog-ng.conf":/etc/syslog-ng/syslog-ng.conf balabit/syslog-ng:latest
```

## Entering into a container
Assume that your running container has a name "syslog-ng". In this case we can enter into this container by executing the following command:

```bash
sudo docker exec -it syslog-ng /bin/bash
```

## FAQ

### capabilities

If the given configuration requires, syslog-ng tries to set some POSIX capabilities at startup, but (by default) Docker do not grant capabilities to the containers. Mainly there are three methods to circumvent this:
 * If you do not require any capability (i.e. don't want to listen on ports under 1024 - NET_BIND_SERVICE), simply start syslog-ng with the `--no-caps` option.
 * If you know precisely the type of capability you need, use the `--cap-add` option of the Docker service.
 * (For development/testing purpose only!) To grant ALL of the capabilities to your container, start it with the `privileged` option. However, we do not recommend this method in production environments.
